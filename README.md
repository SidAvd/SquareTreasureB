## Description

Square Treasure is a React-based game inspired by Minesweeper, where the objective is to find the hidden treasure (ðŸ’Ž) on a grid. The grid cells display the distance to the treasure, and players need to flip the cells strategically to uncover it. The game is won when the player finds the treasure.

1. The game is played on a grid of squares. Each square has a number or a symbol:
   - **Numbers**: Represent the distance to the treasure.
   - **ðŸ’Ž**: Represents the hidden treasure.
   - **?**: Indicates squares that are far from the treasure (based on a certain threshold).
   
2. Click on a square to flip it and reveal its content. If it contains the treasure, you win the game.
3. The number of moves is tracked, and you can restart the game using the **Restart** button at the bottom.
4. The game is over once you find the treasure.
